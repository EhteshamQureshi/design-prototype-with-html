            <h2 class="heading-main">Big Loops</h2>
            <p>These are the big things we want to do or be. Big Loops are largem ambitious targets like running a marathon or getting promotion.
        We tackle them usually over a period of months, or even years.</p>

      

            <h2 class="heading-main">Litle Loops</h2>
            <p>Focus is at the core of this tool and Little Loops are the development cycles / milestones we can identify by beakign down our big target into its key parts. Like being able to run 5 miles, then 10 miles, etc. We usually work towards these over the course of weeks.

                            <h2 class="heading-main">Micro Loops</h2>
                            <p>Loop's secret weapon is one we all have: the ability to reflect. Each day you will take a moment to answer 3 simple coaching questions to process and improve your progress. Micro Loops are the tiny steps we can take towards our Little and Big Loops each day. Like hydrating well before a run or trying small tweaks to running technique.
